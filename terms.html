</ul>
<p>
	The alternative to participation in this study is to choose not to participate and to close the website tab. If you have any questions, concerns, or complaints about the informed consent process of this research study or your 	rights as a human research subject, please contact Prof. Dr. Valentin Schwind. Please read the following information carefully and take the time you need.
</p>
<h4>1. Purpose and Goal of this Research</h4>
<p>
	The purpose of the research is to investigate how the information throughput varies between different devices and settings. The goal is to understand how the devices and settings influence human-machine information throughput. Your participation will help us achieve this research goal. The results of this research may be presented at scientific or professional meetings or published in scientific proceedings and journals.
</p>
<h4>2. Study Participation</h4>
<p>
	Your participation in this online study is entirely voluntary and can be discontinued or withdrawn at any time. You can refuse to answer any questions or continue with the study at any time if you 	feel uncomfortable in any way. You can discontinue or withdraw your participation at any time without giving a reason. However, we reserve the right to exclude you from the study (e.g., with 	invalid trials or if continuing the study could have a negative impact on your well-being or the equipment).
</p>
<h4>3. Study Procedure</h4>
<p class="small-padding">After confirming this informed consent the procedure is as follows:</p>
<ol class="small-padding">
	<li>Fill in the demographics questionnaire</li>
	<li>Click each (blue) target as quickly and accurately as you can</li>
	<li>Checkout your results and note your anonymized ID if you like to have access to your data</li>
</ol>
<p>The confirmation of participation in this study can be obtained directly from the researchers.</p>
<h4>4. Risks and Benefits</h4>
<p>
	In the online study you will not be exposed to any immediate risk or danger. As with all computer systems on which data is processed, despite security measures, there is a small risk of data	leakage and the loss of confidential or personal information. You have no direct benefit from participating in the study, but your support our work and help to advance research in this area.
</p>
<h4>5. Data Collection, Data Protection and Confidentiality</h4>
<p>
	In this study, anonymized user data are collected for our research. The use of subject-related information is governed by the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and will be treated in accordance with the GDPR. This means that you can view, correct, restrict processing, and delete the data collected in this study. Only with your 	agreement, we will log your input, track body movements, and manually record notes in the study. We plan to publish the results of this and other research studies in academic articles or other 	media. 
  <p>
    Specifically, we will collect:
    <ul>
      <li>Demographic information from the form (e.g., age, gender, occupation, environment).</li>
      <li>Browser and device characteristics (e.g., screen size, language, operating system, touch support).</li>
      <li>Interaction data (e.g., mouse movements, clicks, movement paths, hit accuracy, reaction times).</li>
      <li>Essential cookies (`Subject ID` and `Number of Experiments`) to manage your session anonymously.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  Your data will not be retained for longer than necessary or until you contact researchers (you need your automatically generated subject ID from the end of the experiment) to have your data destroyed or deleted. Access to the raw data, transcribed interviews, and observation protocols of the study during the analysis is encrypted, password-protected and only accessible to the authors, colleagues, and researchers collaborating on this research. As part of he research, the data will be anonymized using code numbers and then be made available to the general public, whereas without information from the researchers no conclusions can be drawn about 	individual persons. Once the material has been made publicly available, the distribution of the data can no longer be revoked. Any interview content or direct quotations from the interview, that 	are made available through academic publications or other academic outlets will also be anonymized using code numbers. Since no contact details (e.g. emails) are collected, the researchers cannot 	inform the participants about further details of the study or about a possible breach of confidential data.
